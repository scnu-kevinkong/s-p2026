After finding the statue, the robot can pick it up, which follows the action rules.\n\n3. **find Shelf**: This step is correct and matches the reference step. The robot needs to locate the shelf before placing the statue on it.\n\n4. **find Shelf**: This step is redundant. The robot has already found the shelf in the previous step. Instead, the robot should perform the `put shelf` action to complete the task of placing the statue on the shelf.\n\n**Feasibility:**\n\n- The robot's steps are partially feasible. Steps 1 to 3 are correctly executed and follow the action rules. However, step 4 is incorrect because it repeats the `find Shelf` action instead of placing the statue on the shelf. The task cannot be completed without the `put shelf` action.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe robot's planning steps do not fully achieve the task because the final action required to place the statue on the shelf is missing. Therefore, the planning results are not capable of completing the task as specified.\n\nRating: [[fail]]", 0]}
